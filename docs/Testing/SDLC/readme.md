# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Overview

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for building software that ensures quality, efficiency, and alignment with business goals. Below we explore both the general framework and specific SDLC models in detail.

## Key Phases of SDLC

While models vary, most SDLCs include these core phases:

1. **Planning & Requirements Analysis**
    - Define project scope, goals, and feasibility.
    - Gather and document functional/non-functional requirements.
2. **Design**
    - Create system architecture (UI, databases, APIs).
    - Specify technologies and tools.
3. **Implementation (Coding)**
    - Developers write code based on design specifications.
4. **Testing**
    - Verify functionality (unit, integration, system, UAT).
    - Identify and fix defects.
5. **Deployment**
    - Release software to production (phased rollout or full launch).
6. **Maintenance**
    - Provide updates, patches, and enhancements.

## Popular SDLC Models

| Model            | Key Characteristics                          | Best For                          |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Waterfall**    | Linear, sequential phases                   | Stable requirements, short projects |
| **V-Shaped**     | Testing parallel to development             | High-reliability systems (e.g., medical) |
| **Prototyping**  | Iterative user feedback loops               | Unclear or evolving requirements |
| **RAD**          | Rapid delivery via workshops and tools      | Modular, user-driven projects |
| **Incremental**  | Deliver functional pieces incrementally     | Large projects needing early releases |
| **Spiral**       | Risk-driven iterative cycles                | Complex, high-risk projects |
| **Agile**        | Flexible, iterative, customer-collaborative | Dynamic requirements (e.g., startups) |

## Why SDLC Matters

- **Predictability**: Provides clear milestones and deliverables.
- **Quality Control**: Ensures testing and validation at each stage.
- **Risk Management**: Identifies issues early (e.g., Spiral model).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces rework through structured planning.

## Choosing the Right Model

- Consider:
    - **Project size** (Agile for small teams, Waterfall for large-scale).
    - **Requirement stability** (Waterfall if fixed, Agile/Prototyping if volatile).
    - **Risk tolerance** (Spiral for high-risk, Incremental for phased risk).
    - **Time constraints** (RAD for speed, Waterfall for predictable timelines).

## Key Takeaways

- SDLC standardizes software development processes.
- No "one-size-fits-all" modelâ€”select based on project needs.
- Hybrid approaches (e.g., Agile + Waterfall) are increasingly common.

## Detailed Model Explanations

### 1. Waterfall Model

#### Characteristics:

- Strict linear progression
- Each phase must be 100% complete before next begins
- Comprehensive documentation

#### Pros:

- Easy to understand and manage
- Clear milestones and deliverables
- Good for regulated industries (medical, banking)

#### Cons:

- Inflexible to changes
- Testing occurs too late
- Poor fit for complex projects

#### When to Use:

- Requirements are fixed and well-documented
- Short duration projects (<6 months)
- Similar previous projects exist

### 2. V Model

#### Characteristics:

- Verification and validation for each phase
- Testing planned parallel to development
- Strict discipline required

#### Pros:

- Early defect detection
- High reliability output
- Clear accountability

#### Cons:

- No iteration flexibility
- High documentation overhead

#### When to Use:

- Mission-critical systems
- Where reliability > speed
- Aerospace, medical devices

### 3. Prototyping Model

#### Characteristics:

- Rapid prototype development
- User feedback driven iterations
- Evolutionary approach

#### Pros:

- Early user validation
- Reduced requirement risks
- Good for UI-heavy apps

#### Cons:

- Potential scope creep
- Documentation challenges

#### When to Use:

- Unclear requirements
- User interface development
- Proof-of-concept projects

### 4. RAD Model

#### Characteristics:

- Time-boxed development (60-90 days)
- Component-based construction
- Heavy user involvement

#### Pros:

- 60-90% faster delivery
- High customer satisfaction
- Reusable components

#### Cons:

- Requires skilled team
- Not for high complexity

#### When to Use:

- Well-defined scope
- Available skilled resources
- Web/mobile applications

### 5. Incremental Model

#### Characteristics:

- Divide system into modules
- Deliver working increments
- Prioritize high-risk features

#### Pros:

- Early ROI realization
- Risk distribution
- Flexible planning

#### Cons:

- Needs strong architecture
- Integration challenges

#### When to Use:

- Large systems
- Partial funding availability
- Evolving requirements

### 6. Spiral Model

#### Characteristics:

- Risk-driven iterations
- Combines prototyping + waterfall
- 4 quadrants per cycle

#### Pros:

- Early risk identification
- Flexible approach
- Good for R&D

#### Cons:

- Complex to manage
- Expensive for small projects

#### When to Use:

- High-risk projects
- Research initiatives
- Long-term developments

### 7. Agile Models

#### Characteristics:

- Iterative (2-4 week sprints)
- Customer collaboration
- Adaptive planning

#### Key Methods:

- **Scrum**: Sprints with daily standups
- **XP**: Pair programming, TDD
- **Kanban**: Visual workflow

#### Pros:

- Rapid delivery
- Embrace changes
- High transparency

#### Cons:

- Needs disciplined team
- Hard to predict timelines
