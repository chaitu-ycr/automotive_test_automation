<h3 id="fundamentals-of-testing">Fundamentals of Testing</h3>
<h4 id="what-is-testing">What is Testing?</h4>
<p>Testing assesses and improves software quality by discovering defects, verifying requirements, and validating user needs through both dynamic and static methods, while also involving planning, management, and the use of specialized tools and skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing Objectives<ul>
<li>Evaluating work products (requirements, user stories, designs, code)</li>
<li>Causing failures and finding defects</li>
<li>Ensuring required coverage of a test object</li>
<li>Reducing the risk of inadequate software quality</li>
<li>Verifying fulfillment of specified requirements</li>
<li>Ensuring compliance with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements</li>
<li>Providing information for informed stakeholder decisions</li>
<li>Building confidence in the test object's quality</li>
<li>Validating completeness and expected functionality of the test object</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Testing and Debugging<ul>
<li>Testing identifies defects through dynamic or static methods, while debugging involves diagnosing and fixing these defects to ensure software quality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why-is-testing-necessary">Why is Testing Necessary?</h4>
<p>Testing ensures quality by meeting objectives within constraints and involves all stakeholders in identifying software defects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing’s Contributions to Success<ul>
<li>Cost-effective defect detection: Testing helps identify defects cost-effectively, which can then be removed through debugging.</li>
<li>Quality evaluation: Testing directly evaluates the quality of a test object at various SDLC phases, aiding project management decisions.</li>
<li>User representation: Testers ensure users' needs are considered throughout development, providing indirect user representation.</li>
<li>Compliance: Testing may be necessary to meet contractual, legal, or regulatory requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)<ul>
<li>Testing vs. Quality Assurance (QA)<ul>
<li>Testing and QA are not the same.</li>
<li>Testing:<ul>
<li>Product-oriented and corrective.</li>
<li>Focuses on achieving appropriate quality levels.</li>
<li>Major form of quality control.</li>
<li>Includes formal methods, simulation, and prototyping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>QA:<ul>
<li>Process-oriented and preventive.</li>
<li>Focuses on process implementation and improvement.</li>
<li>Ensures good processes generate good products.</li>
<li>Applies to development and testing processes.</li>
<li>Responsibility of everyone on a project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test results:<ul>
<li>Used by both QA and testing.</li>
<li>In testing: fix defects.</li>
<li>In QA: provide feedback on process performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Errors, Defects, Failures, and Root Causes<ul>
<li>Human errors produce defects, leading to failures.</li>
<li>Errors occur due to time pressure, complexity, fatigue, or inadequate training.</li>
<li>Defects can be in documentation, source code, or supporting work products.</li>
<li>Undetected defects early in SDLC lead to issues later.</li>
<li>Executed defects may cause system failures.</li>
<li>Failures can also result from environmental conditions.</li>
<li>Root causes are fundamental reasons for problems.</li>
<li>Root cause analysis helps prevent or reduce future defects and failures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="testing-principles">Testing Principles</h4>
<p>Testing principles provide general guidelines for effective testing, with seven key principles outlined according to ISTQB.</p>
<ol>
<li>Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence.</li>
<li>Exhaustive testing is impossible. use techniques like test case prioritization and risk-based testing.</li>
<li>Early testing saves time and money by preventing defects in derived work products.</li>
<li>Defects cluster together, often in a small number of components.</li>
<li>Repeated tests become less effective. modify tests and data or create new tests.</li>
<li>Testing is context-dependent and varies across different scenarios.</li>
<li>Absence of defects does not guarantee system success. validation is also necessary.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="test-activities-testware-and-test-roles">Test Activities, Testware and Test Roles</h4>
<p>A test process comprises context-dependent activities and tasks tailored during planning, ensuring traceability, managing testware, and adhering to defined roles, as detailed in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2 standard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Test Activities and Tasks<ul>
<li><strong>Test Planning</strong>: Define test objectives and select an approach to achieve them within constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Test Monitoring and Control</strong>: Ongoing checking of test activities and taking actions to meet objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Test Analysis</strong>: Analyze the test basis to identify testable features and define test conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Test Design</strong>: Elaborate test conditions into test cases, define test data requirements, and design the test environment.</li>
<li><strong>Test Implementation</strong>: Create or acquire testware, organize test cases into procedures and suites, and set up the test environment.</li>
<li><strong>Test Execution</strong>: Run tests according to the schedule, compare actual results with expected results, and log and analyze anomalies.</li>
<li><strong>Test Completion</strong>: Occurs at project milestones, handle unresolved defects, archive useful testware, shut down the test environment, and create a test  completion report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test Process in Context<ul>
<li>Testing is integrated into development processes and funded by stakeholders.</li>
<li>The approach to testing depends on various contextual factors:<ul>
<li>Stakeholders' needs and expectations.</li>
<li>Team members' skills and experience.</li>
<li>Business domain specifics and legal regulations.</li>
<li>Technical factors like software type and technology.</li>
<li>Project constraints such as scope, time, and budget.</li>
<li>Organizational factors including structure and policies.</li>
<li>Software development lifecycle and engineering practices.</li>
<li>Availability and usability of tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These factors influence test strategy, techniques, automation, coverage, testware detail, and reporting.</li>

<li>Assists in communicating technical aspects to stakeholders.</li>
<li>Provides information to assess product quality, process capability, and project progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roles in Testing<ul>
<li>Two principal roles in testing: test management and testing roles.</li>
<li>Roles depend on project/product context, skills, and organization.</li>
<li>Test management role:<ul>
<li>Responsible for test process, team, and leadership.</li>
<li>Focuses on test planning, monitoring, control, and completion.</li>
<li>Varies by context (e.g., Agile teams may handle some tasks).</li>
<li>Tasks spanning multiple teams may be handled by external test managers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Testing role:<ul>
<li>Responsible for technical aspects of testing.</li>
<li>Focuses on test analysis, design, implementation, and execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roles can be performed by different people or combined by one person.</li>
<li>Test management can be done by team leaders, test managers, or development managers.</li>
<li>One person can handle both testing and test management roles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="essential-skills-and-good-practices-in-testing">Essential Skills and Good Practices in Testing</h4>
<p>Good testers need essential skills, teamwork, and the ability to perform testing at various levels of independence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generic Skills Required for Testing<ul>
<li>Relevant skills for testers:<ul>
<li>Testing knowledge</li>
<li>Thoroughness, carefulness, curiosity, attention to details, methodical approach</li>
<li>Good communication skills, active listening, teamwork</li>
<li>Analytical thinking, critical thinking, creativity</li>
<li>Technical knowledge</li>
<li>Domain knowledge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Importance of communication skills for testers:<ul>
<li>Testers often deliver bad news</li>
<li>Communication skills help in conveying information effectively</li>
<li>Test results may be perceived as criticism</li>
<li>Constructive communication can improve the perception of testing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whole Team Approach<ul>
<li>Effective teamwork and positive contribution are key skills for testers.</li>
<li>The whole team approach from Extreme Programming emphasizes these skills.</li>
<li>Any team member can perform any task if they have the necessary knowledge and skills.</li>
<li>Everyone is responsible for quality.</li>
<li>Shared workspace (physical or virtual) enhances communication and interaction.</li>
<li>The whole team approach improves team dynamics, communication, collaboration, and leverages diverse skill sets.</li>
<li>Testers collaborate with business representatives and developers to ensure quality.</li>
<li>Testers help create acceptance tests and agree on test strategies and automation.</li>
<li>Testers transfer knowledge and influence product development.</li>
<li>The whole team approach may not be suitable in contexts requiring high test independence, such as safety-critical situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Independence of Testing<ul>
<li>Independence in testing helps find defects due to different cognitive biases.</li>
<li>Familiarity with the code also aids in defect detection.</li>
<li>Testing can be done by:<ul>
<li>The author (no independence)</li>
<li>Peers from the same team (some independence)</li>
<li>Testers from outside the team but within the organization (high independence)</li>
<li>Testers from outside the organization (very high independence)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple levels of independence in testing are usually best for projects.</li>
<li>Benefits of independent testing:<ul>
<li>Different perspectives lead to recognizing different failures and defects.</li>
<li>Independent testers can challenge assumptions made during specification and implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drawbacks of independent testing:<ul>
<li>Potential isolation from the development team.</li>
<li>Possible communication problems and adversarial relationships.</li>
<li>Developers may lose responsibility for quality.</li>
<li>Independent testers may be seen as bottlenecks or blamed for delays.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="testing-throughout-the-software-development-lifecycle">Testing Throughout the Software Development Lifecycle</h3>
<h4 id="testing-in-the-context-of-a-software-development-lifecycle-sdlc">Testing in the Context of a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</h4>
<ul>
<li>SDLC models represent the software development process and define phase relationships.<ul>
<li>Examples:<ul>
<li>Sequential: waterfall, V-model.</li>
<li>Iterative: spiral, prototyping.</li>
<li>Incremental: Unified Process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Agile practices and methods:<ul>
<li>ATDD, BDD, DDD, XP, FDD, Kanban, Lean IT, Scrum, TDD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impact of the Software Development Lifecycle on Testing<ul>
<li>Testing must align with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for success.</li>
<li>The SDLC choice affects:<ul>
<li>Scope and timing of test activities</li>
<li>Detail level of test documentation</li>
<li>Choice of test techniques and approach</li>
<li>Extent of test automation</li>
<li>Tester roles and responsibilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In sequential models:<ul>
<li>Testers participate in requirement reviews, test analysis, and test design early.</li>
<li>Dynamic testing occurs in later phases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In iterative and incremental models:<ul>
<li>Each iteration delivers a working prototype or increment.</li>
<li>Both static and dynamic testing can be performed in each iteration.</li>
<li>Frequent increments require fast feedback and extensive regression testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In Agile development:<ul>
<li>Change is expected throughout the project.</li>
<li>Lightweight documentation and extensive test automation are favored.</li>
<li>Manual testing often uses experience-based techniques.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software Development Lifecycle and Good Testing Practices<ul>
<li>For every software development activity, there is a corresponding test activity to ensure quality control.</li>
<li>Different test levels have specific objectives to make testing comprehensive and avoid redundancy.</li>
<li>Test analysis and design for a test level begin during the corresponding development phase to adhere to early testing principles.</li>
<li>Testers review work products as soon as drafts are available to support early testing and defect detection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Testing as a Driver for Software Development<ul>
<li><strong>TDD, ATDD, and BDD</strong> are development approaches where tests guide development.</li>
<li><strong>Early Testing Principle</strong>: Tests are defined before code is written, supporting iterative development.</li>
<li><strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong>:<ul>
<li>Coding is directed through test cases.</li>
<li>Tests are written first, followed by code to satisfy the tests, then refactoring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)</strong>:<ul>
<li>Tests are derived from acceptance criteria during system design.</li>
<li>Tests are written before developing the application part to satisfy the tests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)</strong>:<ul>
<li>Desired behavior is expressed with test cases in natural language (Given/When/Then format).</li>
<li>Test cases are automatically translated into executable tests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Automated Tests</strong>: Persist to ensure code quality in future adaptations/refactoring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DevOps and Testing<ul>
<li><strong>DevOps Overview</strong>:<ul>
<li>Organizational approach to create synergy between development (including testing) and operations.</li>
<li>Requires a cultural shift to bridge gaps and treat functions with equal value.</li>
<li>Promotes team autonomy, fast feedback, integrated toolchains, and technical practices like CI and CD.</li>
<li>Enables faster building, testing, and releasing of high-quality code through a DevOps delivery pipeline (Kim 2016).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Benefits of DevOps from a Testing Perspective</strong>:<ul>
<li>Fast feedback on code quality and impact on existing code.</li>
<li>CI promotes shift left in testing by encouraging high-quality code submission with component tests and static analysis.</li>
<li>Promotes automated processes like CI/CD for stable test environments.</li>
<li>Increases visibility on non-functional quality characteristics (e.g., performance efficiency, reliability).</li>
<li>Reduces need for repetitive manual testing through automation.</li>
<li>Minimizes risk of regression with extensive automated regression tests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Risks of DevOps</strong>:<ul>
<li>Defining and establishing the DevOps delivery pipeline.</li>
<li>Introducing and maintaining CI/CD tools.</li>
<li>Additional resources required for test automation, which may be difficult to establish and maintain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Manual Testing</strong>:<ul>
<li>Despite high levels of automated testing, manual testing from the user's perspective is still needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shift Left<ul>
<li>Early testing, also known as shift left, involves testing earlier in the SDLC.</li>
<li>Shift left does not mean neglecting later testing stages.</li>
<li>Good practices for shift left:<ul>
<li>Review specifications from testers' perspective to find defects.</li>
<li>Write test cases before code and use a test harness during implementation.</li>
<li>Use CI/CD for fast feedback and automated tests.</li>
<li>Perform static analysis before dynamic testing.</li>
<li>Start non-functional testing at the component level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shift left may require extra training, effort, and costs initially but saves resources later.</li>
<li>Stakeholder buy-in is crucial for successful shift left implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Retrospectives and Process Improvement<ul>
<li>Retrospectives are held at the end of a project, iteration, or release milestone.</li>
<li>Timing and organization depend on the SDLC model.</li>
<li>Participants include testers, developers, architects, product owners, and business analysts.</li>
<li>Discussions focus on:<ul>
<li>What was successful and should be retained?</li>
<li>What was not successful and could be improved?</li>
<li>How to incorporate improvements and retain successes in the future?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Results are recorded and typically part of the test completion report.</li>
<li>Retrospectives are crucial for continuous improvement.</li>
<li>Recommended improvements should be followed up.</li>
<li>Benefits for testing include:<ul>
<li>Increased test effectiveness/efficiency.</li>
<li>Improved quality of testware.</li>
<li>Team bonding and learning.</li>
<li>Enhanced quality of the test basis.</li>
<li>Better cooperation between development and testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confirmation and regression testing are needed at all test levels if defects are fixed or changes are made.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="maintenance-testing">Maintenance Testing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Categories of maintenance:<ul>
<li>Corrective</li>
<li>Adaptive to environmental changes</li>
<li>Performance or maintainability improvements (see ISO/IEC 14764)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maintenance involves:<ul>

<li>Upgrades/migrations of the operational environment</li>
<li>Retirement of applications (testing data archiving, restore, and retrieval procedures)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="static-testing">Static Testing</h3>
<h4 id="static-testing-basics">Static Testing Basics</h4>
<p>Static testing involves evaluating software without execution to improve quality, detect defects, and assess characteristics using manual reviews or tools, and can be used for both verification and validation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Work Products Examinable by Static Testing<ul>
<li>Static testing can be applied to various work products:<ul>
<li>Requirement specification documents</li>
<li>Source code</li>
<li>Test plans and test cases</li>
<li>Product backlog items</li>
<li>Test charters</li>
<li>Project documentation</li>
<li>Contracts and models</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any readable and understandable work product can be reviewed.</li>
<li>Static analysis requires structured work products (e.g., models, code, or text with formal syntax).</li>
<li>Work products not suitable for static testing:<ul>
<li>Difficult to interpret by humans</li>
<li>Should not be analyzed by tools (e.g., 3rd party executable code due to legal reasons)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Value of Static Testing<ul>
<li><strong>Early Defect Detection</strong>: Static testing can identify defects early in the SDLC, supporting the principle of early testing.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Defect Identification</strong>: Detects defects not found by dynamic testing (e.g., unreachable code, design pattern issues, non-executable work product defects).</li>
<li><strong>Quality Evaluation</strong>: Helps evaluate the quality of work products and build confidence in them.</li>
<li><strong>Requirement Verification</strong>: Ensures documented requirements meet stakeholders' actual needs.</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Communication</strong>: Improves communication and understanding among stakeholders by involving them in static testing.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>: Although reviews can be costly, they reduce overall project costs by minimizing defect fixing efforts later.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Defect Detection</strong>: Static analysis can detect certain code defects more efficiently than dynamic testing, leading to fewer defects and lower development effort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Differences between Static Testing and Dynamic Testing<ul>
<li><strong>Static and Dynamic Testing</strong>:<ul>
<li>Both aim to detect defects in work products.</li>
<li>Differences include:<ul>
<li>Some defects can only be found by either static or dynamic testing.</li>
<li>Static testing finds defects directly; dynamic testing causes failures to identify defects.</li>
<li>Static testing can detect defects in rarely executed code paths.</li>
<li>Static testing applies to non-executable work products; dynamic testing applies to executable ones.</li>
<li>Static testing measures quality characteristics not dependent on code execution; dynamic testing measures those dependent on code execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defects Easier/Cheaper to Find via Static Testing</strong>:<ul>
<li>Requirements defects (e.g., inconsistencies, ambiguities).</li>
<li>Design defects (e.g., inefficient database structures).</li>
<li>Certain coding defects (e.g., undefined variables, unreachable code).</li>
<li>Deviations from standards (e.g., naming conventions).</li>
<li>Incorrect interface specifications (e.g., mismatched parameters).</li>
<li>Specific security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows).</li>
<li>Gaps or inaccuracies in test basis coverage (e.g., missing tests for acceptance criteria).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="feedback-and-review-process">Feedback and Review Process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Benefits of Early and Frequent Stakeholder Feedback<ul>
<li>Early and frequent feedback helps communicate potential quality problems early.</li>
<li>Limited stakeholder involvement during the SDLC can lead to:<ul>
<li>Misalignment with the stakeholder's vision.</li>
<li>Costly rework and missed deadlines.</li>
<li>Blame-shifting and potential project failure.</li>
</ul>

<li>Positive impact on identified risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review Process Activities<ul>
<li><strong>ISO/IEC 20246 Standard</strong>: Defines a flexible review process framework.</li>
<li><strong>Review Process Activities</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Planning</strong>: Define scope, purpose, work product, quality characteristics, focus areas, exit criteria, supporting information, effort, and timeframes.</li>
<li><strong>Review Initiation</strong>: Ensure participants are prepared, have access to the work product, understand roles and responsibilities, and have necessary resources.</li>
<li><strong>Individual Review</strong>: Reviewers assess work product quality, identify anomalies, recommendations, and questions using review techniques (e.g., checklist-based, scenario-based). Log findings.</li>
<li><strong>Communication and Analysis</strong>: Analyze and discuss anomalies, decide on status, ownership, and actions. Determine quality level and follow-up actions in review meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Fixing and Reporting</strong>: Create defect reports for corrective actions. Accept work product once exit criteria are met and report review results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roles and Responsibilities in Reviews<ul>
<li><strong>Manager</strong>: Decides what to review and provides resources.</li>
<li><strong>Author</strong>: Creates and fixes the work product under review.</li>
<li><strong>Moderator (Facilitator)</strong>: Ensures effective review meetings, including mediation and time management.</li>
<li><strong>Scribe (Recorder)</strong>: Records anomalies and review information.</li>
<li><strong>Reviewer</strong>: Performs reviews; can be a project member, expert, or stakeholder.</li>
<li><strong>Review Leader</strong>: Takes overall responsibility for the review, including participant selection and scheduling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review Types<ul>
<li><strong>Review Types</strong>: Range from informal to formal, depending on factors like SDLC, development process maturity, work product criticality, legal requirements, and audit needs.</li>
<li><strong>Selection Criteria</strong>: Based on review objectives, project needs, resources, work product type, risks, business domain, and company culture.</li>
<li><strong>Common Review Types</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Informal Review</strong>: No defined process or formal output; main objective is anomaly detection.</li>
<li><strong>Walkthrough</strong>: Led by the author; objectives include quality evaluation, confidence building, reviewer education, consensus gaining, idea generation, author motivation, and anomaly detection.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Review</strong>: Performed by technically qualified reviewers and led by a moderator; objectives include consensus gaining, decision making on technical problems, anomaly detection, quality evaluation, confidence building, idea generation, and author motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Inspection</strong>: Most formal type; follows a complete generic process; main objective is anomaly detection; other objectives include quality evaluation, confidence building, author motivation, and SDLC improvement through collected metrics; author cannot be the review leader or scribe.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>Classification of Test Techniques</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Black-box (Specification-based)</strong>:<ul>
<li>Based on specified behavior without reference to internal structure.</li>
<li>Test cases remain useful if implementation changes but behavior stays the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Based on internal structure and processing.</li>
<li>Test cases created after design or implementation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Experience-based</strong>:<ul>
<li>Use tester's knowledge and experience.</li>
<li>Effectiveness depends on tester’s skills.</li>
<li>Can detect defects missed by black-box and white-box techniques.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="black-box-test-techniques">Black-Box Test Techniques</h4>
<p>Common software testing techniques include Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Table Testing, and State Transition Testing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Equivalence Partitioning<ul>
<li><strong>Equivalence Partitioning (EP)</strong>: Divides data into partitions based on the expectation that all elements in a partition are processed the same way by the test object.</li>
<li><strong>Theory</strong>: If a defect is detected by testing one value from a partition, it should be detected by testing any other value from the same partition.</li>
<li><strong>Identification</strong>: Partitions can be identified for any data element related to the test object, including inputs, outputs, configuration items, internal values, time-related values, and interface parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: Partitions may be continuous or discrete, ordered or unordered, finite or infinite. They must not overlap and must be non-empty sets.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Partitioning can be easy for simple test items but often complicated in practice.</li>
<li><strong>Valid and Invalid Partitions</strong>:<ul>
<li>Valid partition: Contains values that should be processed by the test object.</li>
<li>Invalid partition: Contains values that should be ignored or rejected by the test object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Coverage</strong>:<ul>
<li>Coverage items are the equivalence partitions.</li>
<li>100% coverage requires test cases to exercise all identified partitions at least once.</li>
<li>Coverage is measured as the number of partitions exercised by at least one test case divided by the total number of identified partitions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Sets of Partitions</strong>:<ul>
<li>Test items with more than one input parameter include multiple sets of partitions.</li>
<li>Each Choice coverage requires test cases to exercise each partition from each set of partitions at least once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Boundary Value Analysis<ul>
<li><strong>Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)</strong>: Test technique for ordered partitions.</li>
<li><strong>Boundary Values</strong>: Minimum and maximum values of a partition.</li>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Boundary values are prone to developer errors.</li>
<li><strong>Defects</strong>: Misplaced or omitted boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>Versions</strong>: 2-value BVA and 3-value BVA.<ul>
<li><strong>2-value BVA</strong>:<ul>
<li>Two coverage items per boundary: boundary value and closest neighbor.</li>
<li>100% coverage: Exercise all boundary values.</li>
<li>Coverage: (Exercised boundary values / Total boundary values) * 100%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>3-value BVA</strong>:<ul>
<li>Three coverage items per boundary: boundary value and both neighbors.</li>
<li>100% coverage: Exercise all boundary values and neighbors.</li>
<li>Coverage: (Exercised boundary values and neighbors / Total boundary values and neighbors) * 100%.</li>
<li>More rigorous, detects more defects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Incorrect implementation of “if (x ≤ 10)” as “if (x = 10)” detected by 3-value BVA.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision Table Testing<ul>
<li><strong>Decision Tables</strong>: Used for testing requirements by specifying how different combinations of conditions result in different outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Logic</strong>: Effective for recording complex logic, such as business rules.</li>
<li><strong>Structure</strong>:<ul>
<li>Rows: Conditions and resulting actions.</li>
<li>Columns: Decision rules defining unique combinations of conditions and associated actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Types</strong>:<ul>
<li>Limited-entry: Conditions and actions shown as Boolean values (true/false).</li>
<li>Extended-entry: Conditions and actions may take multiple values (e.g., ranges, discrete values).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Notation</strong>:<ul>
<li>Conditions:<ul>
<li>"T" (true): Condition satisfied.</li>
<li>"F" (false): Condition not satisfied.</li>
<li>"–": Condition irrelevant.</li>
<li>"N/A": Condition infeasible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actions:<ul>
<li>"X": Action should occur.</li>
<li>Blank: Action should not occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Full Decision Table</strong>: Covers every combination of conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Simplification</strong>: Delete infeasible combinations or merge columns where conditions do not affect the outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Coverage</strong>:<ul>
<li>Coverage items: Columns with feasible combinations of conditions.</li>
<li>100% coverage: Test cases must exercise all feasible columns.</li>
<li>Coverage measured as the number of exercised columns divided by total feasible columns, expressed as a percentage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Strengths</strong>:<ul>
<li>Systematic approach to identify all combinations of conditions.</li>
<li>Helps find gaps or contradictions in requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Challenges</strong>:<ul>
<li>Many conditions can make exercising all decision rules time-consuming.</li>
<li>Use minimized decision table or risk-based approach to reduce the number of rules to be exercised.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State Transition Testing<ul>
<li><strong>State Diagram</strong>: Models system behavior with states and transitions.<ul>
<li><strong>Transition</strong>: Triggered by an event, may have guard conditions and actions.</li>
<li><strong>Syntax</strong>: event [guard condition] / action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>State Table</strong>: Equivalent to a state diagram.<ul>
<li><strong>Rows</strong>: Represent states.</li>
<li><strong>Columns</strong>: Represent events and guard conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Cells</strong>: Represent transitions, target states, and actions.</li>
<li><strong>Invalid Transitions</strong>: Shown as empty cells.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Test Cases</strong>: Sequence of events causing state changes and actions.<ul>
<li><strong>Coverage Criteria</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>All States Coverage</strong>: Ensure all states are exercised.</li>
<li><strong>Valid Transitions Coverage (0-switch)</strong>: Ensure all valid transitions are exercised.</li>
<li><strong>All Transitions Coverage</strong>: Ensure all valid and invalid transitions are exercised or attempted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Coverage Measurement</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>All States Coverage</strong>: Exercised states / Total states.</li>
<li><strong>Valid Transitions Coverage</strong>: Exercised valid transitions / Total valid transitions.</li>
<li><strong>All Transitions Coverage</strong>: Exercised or attempted transitions / Total transitions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Coverage Strength</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>All States Coverage</strong>: Weaker, may not exercise all transitions.</li>
<li><strong>Valid Transitions Coverage</strong>: Guarantees all states coverage.</li>
<li><strong>All Transitions Coverage</strong>: Guarantees both all states and valid transitions coverage, essential for critical software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="white-box-test-techniques">White-Box Test Techniques</h4>
<ul>
<li>Statement Testing and Statement Coverage<ul>
<li>Statement testing focuses on executable statements.</li>
<li>Test cases are designed to achieve an acceptable level of coverage.</li>
<li>Coverage is the ratio of exercised statements to total executable statements, expressed as a percentage.</li>
<li>100% statement coverage means all executable statements are exercised at least once.</li>
<li>Detects defects by executing statements, but not all defects (e.g., data-dependent defects).</li>
<li>100% statement coverage does not ensure all decision logic is tested (e.g., not all branches are exercised).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Branch Testing and Branch Coverage<ul>
<li><strong>Branch</strong>: Transfer of control between nodes in the control flow graph.</li>
<li><strong>Types of Branches</strong>:<ul>
<li>Unconditional (straight-line code)</li>
<li>Conditional (decision outcome)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Branch Testing</strong>:<ul>
<li>Aim: Design test cases to exercise branches until acceptable coverage is achieved.</li>
<li>Coverage: Measured as the number of branches exercised divided by the total number of branches, expressed as a percentage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>100% Branch Coverage</strong>:<ul>
<li>All branches (unconditional and conditional) are exercised by test cases.</li>
<li>Conditional branches include outcomes from "if...then" decisions, switch/case statements, or loop decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Limitations</strong>:<ul>
<li>May not detect defects requiring specific path execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Branch Coverage vs. Statement Coverage</strong>:<ul>
<li>100% branch coverage implies 100% statement coverage.</li>
<li>100% statement coverage does not imply 100% branch coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Value of White-box Testing<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths of White-Box Testing:</strong><ul>
<li>Considers the entire software implementation.</li>
<li>Facilitates defect detection even with vague, outdated, or incomplete specifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Weaknesses of White-Box Testing:</strong><ul>
<li>May not detect defects of omission if the software does not implement one or more requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Usage in Static Testing:</strong><ul>
<li>Suitable for dry runs of code.</li>
<li>Can be used to review code not yet ready for execution, pseudocode, and high-level logic modeled with a control flow graph.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comparison with Black-Box Testing:</strong><ul>
<li>Black-box testing does not measure actual code coverage.</li>
<li>White-box coverage measures provide objective coverage measurement.</li>
<li>Helps generate additional tests to increase coverage and confidence in the code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Exploratory Testing<ul>
<li>Exploratory testing involves designing, executing, and evaluating tests simultaneously.</li>
<li>It helps learn more about the test object and create tests for untested areas.</li>
<li>Often performed using session-based testing within a defined time box.</li>
<li>Testers use a test charter with objectives to guide the testing.</li>
<li>Sessions are followed by debriefings with stakeholders.</li>
<li>Useful when specifications are inadequate or under time pressure.</li>
<li>Complements formal test techniques.</li>
<li>More effective with experienced testers with domain knowledge and essential skills.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Checklist-Based Testing<ul>
<li><strong>Checklist-based testing</strong>:<ul>
<li>Tester designs, implements, and executes tests based on a checklist.</li>
<li>Checklists are built from experience, user importance, or understanding of software failures.</li>
<li>Avoid items that can be checked automatically, are entry/exit criteria, or are too general.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Checklist items</strong>:<ul>
<li>Often phrased as questions.</li>
<li>Should be checkable separately and directly.</li>
<li>May refer to requirements, graphical interface properties, quality characteristics, or other test conditions.</li>
<li>Support various test types, including functional and non-functional testing (e.g., Nielsen's 10 heuristics for usability testing).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance of checklists</strong>:<ul>
<li>Regular updates based on defect analysis.</li>
<li>Avoid making the checklist too long.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Benefits and limitations</strong>:<ul>
<li>Provides guidelines and consistency in the absence of detailed test cases.</li>
<li>High-level checklists may lead to variability in testing, resulting in greater coverage but less repeatability.</li>

<li>The test pyramid is a model that illustrates different test granularities.</li>
<li>It aids in test automation and effort allocation by showing different test objectives supported by various levels of automation.</li>
<li>Pyramid layers represent groups of tests:<ul>
<li>Higher layers: Lower granularity, lower isolation, higher execution time.</li>
<li>Lower layers: Higher granularity, higher isolation, faster execution time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bottom layer tests:<ul>
<li>Small, isolated, fast.</li>
<li>Check small pieces of functionality.</li>
<li>Require many tests for reasonable coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Top layer tests:<ul>
<li>Complex, high-level, end-to-end.</li>
<li>Slower execution.</li>
<li>Check large pieces of functionality.</li>
<li>Require fewer tests for reasonable coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Layer names and numbers can vary:<ul>
<li>Original model (Cohn 2009): Unit tests, service tests, UI tests.</li>
<li>Another model: Unit (component) tests, integration (component integration) tests, end-to-end tests.</li>
<li>Other test levels can also be used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Risk Definition and Risk Attributes<ul>
<li>Risk is a potential event, hazard, threat, or situation causing adverse effects.</li>
<li>Characterized by:<ul>
<li><strong>Risk likelihood</strong>: Probability of occurrence (between 0 and 1)</li>
<li><strong>Risk impact (harm)</strong>: Consequences of occurrence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk level is determined by these factors.</li>
<li>Higher risk level necessitates more important treatment.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4 id="autosar">AUTOSAR</h4>
<p>AUTOSAR, established in 2003, is a partnership of automotive industry producers and suppliers aimed at creating a standard software architecture for vehicles. This globally recognized standard addresses the growing complexity of automotive software, making it essential for testers to understand its objectives, design, and relevance to their work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Objectives of AUTOSAR<ul>
<li>The following project objectives for AUTOSAR are led by the principle “Collaboration in the standards, competition in the implementation”:<ol>
<li>Supports the transferability (portability) of software</li>
<li>Supports the scalability to different vehicle and platform variants</li>
<li>Supports different functional domains</li>
<li>Definition of an open architecture that is maintainable, adjustable, and expandable</li>
<li>Supports the development of reliable systems characterized by availability, reliability, safety (functional and cybersecurity), integrity, and maintainability</li>
<li>Supports a sustainable use of natural resources</li>
<li>Supports the collaboration between various partners</li>
<li>Standardization of basic software functionality of automotive electronic control units (ECUs)</li>
<li>Support of applicable automotive standards for vehicles and state-of-the-art technologies</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General structure of AUTOSAR<ul>
<li>AUTOSAR architecture consists of three layers:<ul>
<li>Hardware-independent layer with AUTOSAR software components (SW-C)</li>
<li>Hardware-oriented layer with standardized basic software (BSW)</li>
<li>Abstraction layer with AUTOSAR runtime environment (RTE) for data exchange control</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AUTOSAR methodology for harmonized control unit software development:<ul>
<li>OEMs and suppliers exchange information via AUTOSAR templates (arxml-files)</li>
<li>Key description files:<ul>
<li>ECU configuration description: Data for SW-C integration on the control unit</li>
<li>System configuration description: Data for integrating all control units in a vehicle</li>
<li>ECU extract: Data from the system configuration description for a single control unit</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Influence of AUTOSAR on the work of the tester<ul>
<li><strong>Software component and integration tests in a virtual environment</strong>: Test SW-Components early using virtual BSW and RTE.</li>
<li><strong>Software and integration tests in the real control unit</strong>: Access RTE communication to measure and stimulate SW-C behavior at runtime.</li>
<li><strong>AUTOSAR acceptance test</strong>: Ensures compliance of AUTOSAR functionality at communication and application levels; execution is optional.</li>
<li><strong>System integration test</strong>: Functional integration of different ECUs, simulating missing functionalities to assess system behavior early.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="comparison">Comparison</h4>
<ul>
<li>Objectives of ASPICE and ISO 26262<ul>
<li><strong>ISO 26262</strong>:<ul>
<li>Objective: Avoid risks from systematic and hardware failures.</li>
<li>Focus: Requirements and processes for E/E systems development.</li>
<li>Dependency: ASIL level of the item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ASPICE</strong>:<ul>

<h4 id="test-environment-in-general">Test environment in general</h4>
<ul>
<li>Motivation for a test environment in the automotive development<ul>
<li>Tester faces challenges:<ul>
<li>Start testing early to find defects.</li>
<li>Needs realistic environment for accurate testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Solution:<ul>
<li>Use suitable test environments matching development phases.</li>
<li>Implement and execute test tasks before ECU is fully developed.</li>
<li>Simulate difficult-to-reproduce situations (e.g., short circuits, open circuits, network overloads).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Benefits:<ul>
<li>Early defect detection.</li>
<li>Realistic testing scenarios.</li>
<li>Improved test coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General parts of a test environment<ul>
<li>Test environment components:<ul>
<li>Hardware: computer, real-time capable computer, test bench, development kit</li>
<li>Software: operating system, simulation software, environment models</li>
<li>Communication facilities: network access, data logger</li>
<li>Tools: oscilloscope, measuring tools</li>
<li>Laboratory: protection from electromagnetic radiation and noise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Environment model:<ul>
<li>Represents real-world aspects: combustion engine, transmissions, vehicle sensors, electronic control units, driver, road conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Access points for measurement and observation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Differences between Closed-Loop and Open-Loop<ul>
<li>Test environment stimulates input interfaces and monitors outputs.</li>
<li>Successful test: observed behavior matches expected output.</li>
<li>Two control systems: closed loop and open loop.<ul>
<li><strong>Open-Loop System</strong>:<ul>
<li>Outputs have no relation to inputs.</li>
<li>No feedback; inputs defined by tester.</li>
<li>Preferred for reactive behavior or state machines.</li>
<li>Examples: interior and chassis electronics (lights, switches).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Closed-Loop System</strong>:<ul>
<li>Considers outputs of the test item.</li>
<li>Uses environment model to create a control loop.</li>
<li>Preferred for testing controllers and complex functions.</li>
<li>Examples: motor/gear controls, ABS®, ESP®.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Essential interfaces, databases and communication protocols of a electronic control unit<ul>
<li>A control unit in the automotive environment is an embedded system with hardware and software.</li>
<li>It receives analogue and digital inputs to collect environmental data (voltage, current, temperature).</li>
<li>Communication bus systems provide additional information from sensors or other control units.</li>
<li>The control unit processes and manages data to generate outputs via analogue/digital pins, bus systems, or diagnosis interfaces.</li>
<li>Databases (data warehouses) define input/output signals, including descriptions, units, and conversion formulas.</li>
<li>Communication protocols describe data exchange via physical interfaces, defining voltage or bit sequences for signal values.</li>
<li>The choice of database and communication protocol depends on the control unit's function.</li>
<li>Example: Accessing diagnosis functions requires knowledge of the database (e.g., ASAM MCD2 D) and communication protocol (e.g., Unified Diagnostic Services per ISO 14229).</li>
<li>Automotive-specific databases are defined in standards like ASAM.</li>

<h4 id="static-test-techniques">Static test techniques</h4>
<ul>
<li>The MISRA-C: 2012 Guidelines<ul>
<li>Developers must comply with coding guidelines for safety-relevant software (ISO 26262).</li>
<li>Coding standards help avoid software anomalies and improve maintainability and portability.</li>
<li>MISRA-C:2012 Guidelines for C programming include:<ul>
<li><strong>Rules</strong>: Verifiable by static analysis tools (e.g., no nested comments).</li>
<li><strong>Directives</strong>: Not entirely verifiable by static tools, often related to development process documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guidelines are categorized into three levels of obligation:<ul>
<li><strong>Advisory</strong>: Follow if effort is appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Required</strong>: Can be neglected with conclusive explanation.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory</strong>: Must be followed without exceptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organizations can intensify but not lower the requirement of a rule or directive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quality characteristics for reviews of requirements<ul>
<li>Specifications are crucial for development and testing.</li>
<li>Defects in specifications lead to costly and time-consuming follow-up activities.</li>
<li>Reviews help find defects early, reducing costs.</li>
<li>During test analysis, testers check specifications for suitability as a test basis.</li>
<li>ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 provides quality characteristics for requirements.</li>
<li>Key characteristics for requirements:<ul>
<li>Verifiable: Can be tested by static or dynamic tests.</li>
<li>Unambiguous: Contains clear test conditions.</li>
<li>Consistent: Consistent within itself and with other requirements.</li>
<li>Complete: Considers all possible cases, with labeled tables and diagrams.</li>
<li>Traceable: Clearly marked for impact analysis and test case coverage.</li>
<li>Bounded: Clearly defined scope for development and testing.</li>
<li>Singular: Cannot be divided into partial requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review checklists can be derived from these characteristics.</li>
<li>Example questions for requirements review:<ul>
<li>Verifiable: Can it be tested on the appropriate level?</li>
<li>Explicit: Prevents room for interpretation.</li>
<li>Consistent: Consistent within itself and with other requirements.</li>
<li>Singular: Cannot be divided into further partial requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional characteristics from Hobbs:<ul>
<li>Feasible, implementation-free, and necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These characteristics influence test design.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dynamic-test-techniques">Dynamic test techniques</h4>
<ul>
<li>Condition testing, multiple condition testing, modified condition/decision testing<ul>
<li><strong>White-box test design techniques</strong>: Derive test cases from the structure of the test item (e.g., source code).</li>
<li><strong>Decision testing</strong>: Design test cases to cover decisions in the code.</li>
<li><strong>Condition testing</strong>: Focus on individual conditions within a decision.<ul>
<li>Each decision consists of one or more "atomic" conditions.</li>
<li>Conditions can be true or false, and the decision's value results from their logical combination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Simple condition testing</strong>:<ul>
<li>Objective: Cover true/false outcomes of each individual condition.</li>
<li>100% condition coverage can be achieved without full decision outcome coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Multiple condition testing</strong>:<ul>
<li>Objective: Cover all combinations of values related to individual conditions.</li>
<li>Ensures each decision outcome is tested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Modified condition/decision testing (MC/DC)</strong>:<ul>
<li>Similar to multiple condition testing.</li>
<li>Focuses on combinations where individual conditions independently influence the decision outcome.</li>
<li>100% MC/DC coverage can be achieved without considering all combinations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Back-to-Back-Testing<ul>
<li><strong>Back-to-back testing</strong>: An approach to testing that compares two or more variants of a test item.</li>
<li><strong>Execution</strong>: The same test case is executed on all variants, and results are compared.</li>
<li><strong>Pass/Fail Criteria</strong>: Test passes if results are identical; differences are analyzed if results differ.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements</strong>: Test items must be based on the same requirements to show comparable behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: To detect unintended differences between test items or environments, not to replace requirement-based tests.</li>
<li><strong>Variants</strong>: Can involve different versions of the same software or comparison of executable models with generated code.</li>
<li><strong>Suitability</strong>: Very suitable for automated test design, especially in model-based testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fault injection testing<ul>
<li>Fault injection testing is an approach for robustness testing.</li>
<li>Programming techniques like error handling help systems react to defects.</li>
<li>Testers can insert defects at:<ul>
<li>External components (e.g., detecting implausible sensor values)</li>
<li>Interfaces (e.g., handling short circuits or lost messages)</li>
<li>Software (e.g., detecting and handling internal defects)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Classic fault injection involves manipulating real components.</li>
<li>External defects can be simulated at run-time, usually in a HiL test environment.</li>
<li>Fault insertion units (FIUs) are used for physical defects like short circuits.</li>
<li>Software-based interface defects can be simulated in a SiL test environment.</li>
<li>Software defects are often inserted in the development environment, which can be time-intensive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Requirements-based testing<ul>
<li>Requirements-based testing focuses on covering requirements with test cases.</li>
<li>Tester decides if the test item meets the requirements.</li>
<li>Process involves analyzing requirements, deriving test conditions, designing, and executing test cases.</li>
<li>Tester refines tests based on results and may create additional test cases.</li>
<li>Additional test practices like experience-based testing are applied to reduce defects.</li>
<li>Incomplete or inconsistent requirements lead to flawed tests.</li>
<li>Detailed requirements may necessitate prioritization of test cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Context-dependent selection of test techniques<ul>
<li>The ISO 26262 standard (Volume 6) suggests using test design techniques based on the ASIL level.</li>
<li>Techniques include:<ul>
<li>Requirements-based testing</li>
<li>Equivalence partitioning</li>
<li>Boundary value analysis</li>
<li>Statement testing</li>
<li>Decision testing</li>
<li>Modified condition/decision testing</li>
<li>Error guessing</li>
<li>Fault injection</li>
<li>Back-to-back testing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Factors influencing the choice of technique:<ul>
<li><strong>State of the Art</strong>: Ensure the technique represents the current state of the art, referencing standards like ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 and ISO 26262.</li>
<li><strong>Test Basis</strong>: The test basis must provide suitable conditions for the technique (e.g., parameter definitions for equivalence classes, linear value ranges for boundary values).</li>
<li><strong>Risk-based Testing</strong>: Identify product risks and consider the risk level when selecting techniques (e.g., boundary value testing is relevant if boundary violations pose a risk).</li>
<li><strong>Test Level</strong>: Determine if the technique is suitable for the test level (e.g., white-box tests for source code, black-box tests for observable test items).</li>
